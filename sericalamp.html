<h2>Description:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The PSN-ADC-EQAMP board has one to four independent amplifier / filter
channels. Each channel has a&nbsp; very low noise front end op-amp, variable
gain stage, 10 Hz or 20 Hz (Note 1) 7 pole
lowpass filter, and a 60 or 20 second 1 pole highpass filter. This board is designed to
be &quot;piggy-backed&quot; with the <a href="serialatod.html">PSN-ADC-SERIAL</a>
or <a href="serialatod.html">PSN-ADC-USB</a> 16-Bit Analog to Digital Converter Board.</p>

<h2>Gain Adjustment:</h2>
<blockquote>
  Each channel has a two-pin jumper that controls the gain of the first op-amp.
  With the jumper in, the gain of the board will be ~145 to ~1700. This range
  should be used with sensors that have a high output voltage, like a geophone.
  With the jumper removed, the gain range is ~600 to ~6000. This input range
  should be used with sensors that produce less of an output voltage.
  <p>Each channel also has a variable gain stage with a range of 1x to 10x. The
  gain trim pot for each channel is marked &quot;Gain&quot; next to the part.
  When setting up your system, the user should first try the board with the gain
  jumper removed and the gain pot turned to minimum (fully counter clockwise).
  If there is too much signal the jumper should be inserted and the gain pot
  adjusted if needed.&nbsp;
  <p>If there is still too much signal you will need to reduce the voltage from
  the sensor by using a resistor divider <a href="/onlinedocs/voltdrop.gif">(schematic)</a>.
  Each channel as a 10k resistor to ground unless you specified a different
  input impendence. This resistor can be used as one leg of the divider. The
  other resistor is placed in the signal path. A 10k resistor will reduce the
  voltage by 2 and a 100k resistor will reduce the voltage by 10. If you have a
  long wire between the sensor and the input to the board the resistor in the
  signal path should be placed near the Amp/Filter board.
</blockquote>
<h2>DC Offset Adjustment:</h2>
<blockquote>
  Each channel also has a DC Offset pot marked &quot;Offset&quot; next to the
  part. This adjustment has been set at the factory. If you do need to set the
  DC offset, adjust the pot for 0.000 volts at the output with no input signal.
  Wait for 1 to 2 minutes after you turn on the power before setting the Offset
  trim pot.

<h2> Connector Information:</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Input Connectors:</b></p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>The input connector for each channel can be one of the following. Please
    specify when ordering.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="conrca.jpg">RCA Jack</a>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>.<a href="con156.jpg">156 Inch 2-Pin Molex</a> connector with mating connector block and
        pins&nbsp;</li>
      <li><a href="conterm.jpg">Terminal Block Screws</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">If the board is placed in the option plastic box you will need to use
    either the .156 Molex or terminal block screw input connector
    option. There is not enough room in the box to use the RCA jack and mating
    plug.</p>
    
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Output Connector:</b></p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>The 26 pin header connector on the board is used to supply the analog signals to
    the A/D board and to power the Amp/Filter board. The connector has the
    following pinout:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Pin 1 - Onboard Analog Input Channel 1</li>
      <li>Pin 3 - Onboard Analog Input Channel 2</li>
      <li>Pin 5 - Onboard Analog Input Channel 3</li>
      <li>Pin 7 - Onboard Analog Input Channel 4 also Connected to J7 Pin 2</li>
      <li>Pin 9 - Analog Input Channel 5 - Connected to J7 Pin 4&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Pin 11 - Analog Input Channel 6 - Connected to J7 Pin 6</li>
      <li>Pin 13 - Analog Input Channel 7 - Connected to J7 Pin 8</li>
      <li>Pin 15 - Analog Input Channel 8 - Connected to J7 Pin 10</li>
      <li>Pin 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 -&nbsp; Analog Grounds for Channels 1
        to 8</li>
      <li>Pins 19 and 21 - +12 VDC Input Power</li>
      <li>Pins 20 and 22 - -12 VDC Input Power</li>
      <li>Pin 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26 - Digital Ground</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The connector J7 is a 5 x 2 pin .1 inch center header that can be used to
    extend the unused A/D channels to other equipment.&nbsp;</p>
